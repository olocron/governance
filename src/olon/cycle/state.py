"""The cycle's carried state + the participants/agents it runs with.

`CycleState` is the TypedDict that flows through the LangGraph StateGraph. It
holds the working set of the consent cycle: the tension, the current proposal,
the objections/votes collected so far, the loop counters (the §2.5 guards), and
the current ConsentState.

A `CycleRun` bundles the state with the agents that act on it + the governance
params + an optional ledger sink. Keeping agents on the run object (not in the
graph state) means the graph stays pure data-in/data-out — the nodes read the
run from a closure and return state deltas.
