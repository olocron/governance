Each node is a pure function: (CycleState, CycleRun) -> CycleState delta. They
call the relevant meta-agent, parse its JSON into a schema model, and (via the
Secretary) emit a LedgerEvent. Nodes never mutate shared state directly — they
return the keys to merge, keeping the graph reproducible.

Guard functions return string keys that must match named conditional edges in

    In consent governance, objections are resolved in the object↔integrate loop BEFORE
    consent is tested, so consent_test is reached only with no objections this
    round — everyone has either consented or abstained. This node records a
    Vote (with AgentRef.weight) for each agent who stated a position, computes
    the weighted tally, and emits consent-reached.

    Abstain counts as neither consent nor objection by default
    (governance.abstain_counts_as == 'neither', ADR open-q #2). If set to
    'consent', abstainers inflate the consent weight.

    S2 back-compat: when no participant positions exist, the DA casts the
    single consent vote (the original S1 behaviour).
