"""The 5 MVP meta-agents (ROADMAP §5, roles 1-5).

Each is a thin `MetaAgent` subclass with a focused system prompt that encodes
its consent-governed responsibility. The consent cycle (cycle/nodes.py) calls these

Design note: prompts ask for JSON where structured output is needed, because
the gateway's default preamble already tells agents to 'respond as JSON when
asked'. The node functions parse and validate that JSON into schema models.
