"""Runs a deliberation live, in a background thread, bridging events to SSE.

`run_deliberation_live()` builds a CycleRun whose ledger_sink persists to the
Postgres ledger AND pushes each event to the FeedBroker (for the SSE stream),
then calls run_cycle in a thread. On completion it closes the feed.

The MVP wires the platform's staff agents + any registered participant agents
(each an LLM-backed participant on the platform's Z.ai gateway). The registered
model/endpoint/key are captured but NOT yet used (S7 federation).
